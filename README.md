Herein are photos of the mosaic I made from busted up openSUSE DVDs for Hack Week 22.
For more details, please see https://ourobengr.com/2023/02/hack-week-22-an-art-project/

Original photos are in the `orig` directory.  Wallpapers in 16:9 and 16:10 can be found
under `wallpaper` (they're basically the photos, centered, on appropriately sized
canvases).
